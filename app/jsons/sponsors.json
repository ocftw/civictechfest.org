It will be held at the same time and at the same location as TICTeC@Taipei and will be a really unique opportunity to showcase open government and civic tech initiatives to the wider IT industry. \nThe World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT) was first held in 1978 by WITSA (World Information Technology & Services Alliance) and has become the premier international IT forum. Discussion topics range from emerging markets and technologies to legal and policy issues, user perspectives, new business opportunities and developing political and economic trends. The WCIT consistently attracts high level, internationally recognized leaders from government, industry and academia."

          "desc": "The Open Culture Foundation (OCF) is a non-partisan, non-profit organization, founded in 2014 by several members of Taiwan's open source community. The main goal of OCF is to support local communities to advocate for the use of open technologies in broader sectors, including open source software, open hardware, and open data. Activities are carried out with government, enterprises, and NGOs to help them better understand the benefits of adopting open source, and promoting the importance of open data to the public sphere. OCF’s belief is that a culture of open collaboration is the foundation for an innovative society, and the engine of a participatory democracy. \nSince its establishment, OCF has supported local communities to run large-scale conferences, seminars, and hackathons, as well as collaborate with a number of international offices and multilateral institutions to deepen Taiwan’s connection to the global open culture community. Past collaboration partners include the American Institute in Taiwan, British Office Taipei, Bureau Francais de Taipei, and the World Bank. OCF also has strong connections with the global open source community, and regularly exchanges experiences with civic tech groups worldwide. Their mission is to build bridges between local and global \"open\" communities, and hope to act as a mediator for open culture."

# TICTeC@Taipei Unconference Sessions

Have a workshop idea? Want to share your civic tech story? Come and propose your unconference session idea! Unconference sessions/talks will be voted on, thus decided by conference attendees. It is time to decide your own conference proceedings! 

There is no set format for unconferences. It can be a talk, a workshop, or even a hackathon that everyone brainstorm ideas and solutions! 

## What is an Unconference?
Unconferences are events selected and run by participants. The program committee will arrange topics with higher votes to the schedule. Participants set the agenda for whatâ€™s discussed, lead the sessions, and create an environment of innovation and productive discussion.

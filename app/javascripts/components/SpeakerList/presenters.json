      "bio": "Ms. Jaclyn Tsai served as a District Court judge before joining IBM as General Counsel in Taiwan and the Greater China area.  She founded Lee, Tsai & Partners in 1998 and specializes in technology law, mergers, technology licensing/assignment matters.  In November 2013, she was invited to serve as the Minister without Portfolio in the Executive Yuan (cabinet), Taiwan, and became one of the few female ministers in the government.  During her term as Minister without Portfolio, she was committed to promoting the accommodation of laws relating to virtual world development, and she also put forth policies and plans in areas such as e-commerce, the startup environment, the maker movement and the new “closed company” section of the Company Act. Jaclyn now utilizes unique private and public experience to act as an adviser to Taiwan, an organization where the open source community and the Taiwan government collaborate to develop a novel, effective conglomeration of civic technologies, government commitments, and mass media dedicated to the public conversation needs of a nation’s democratic process.  The vTaiwan process now routinely leads to the passage of laws by Taiwan’s national legislature. And it’s gaining momentum that on July 26, Taiwan’s new premier declared in a cross-ministry meeting that substantial national issues should go through a vTaiwan-like process.",

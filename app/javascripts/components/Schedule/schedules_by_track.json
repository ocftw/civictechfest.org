These initiatives are aimed at complementing weak or deeply flawed whistleblower protection systems in many countries, and now form a part of the real-world global journalism ecosystem. Despite their prevalence, until now research into the realities of running such sites has been lacking.\n\nMasayuki scrutinizes the history of leaksites and gives a brief overview of background technologies (including SecureDrop, GlobaLeaks and several obscure, now-defunct ones). Drawing on his original research of existing leaksites, based on a taxonomy and the several demographics available, Masayuki presents several case studies of notable examples and discusses their social impacts as well as the legal, cultural and political issues they provoke.\n\nFinally, he chronicles the genesis of his own leaksite for Japan, Whistleblowing.jp, and explains how it operates within the existing Japanese whistleblower protection system and newly enacted Special Secrecy Law."

Thus far, the difficulties inherent in tracking this complex area have made it impossible for even the keenest members of society to participate fully at every stage in the procurement cycle. \n\nPPDC, through years of experience around procurement governance, successfully advocated for the adoption of the Open Contracting Data Standards by the Nigerian Government in 2016. Using a dedicated platform known as Budeshi it was possible to demonstrate to public institutions the benefits of using unique identifiers to link budget and procurement data to public services. \n\nThe adoption resulted in an influx of requests and commitment from public institutions. One immediate result may be a reduction in the administrative burden of responding to Freedom of Information requests, as procurement information would be proactively published in a coherent way. \n\nThe process of piloting these standards holds several lessons, challenges and opportunities that showcase how Civic Technology can transform interactions between government and citizens; and how that can impact public service delivery.

Drawing on this detailed data and the laws around expenses, the Serenata de Amor Operation team built an artificial intelligence capable of analyzing each expense and rating it for the probability of having broken the law. \n\nTo date the program has found more than 8,000 suspicious returns, using a set of six simple hypotheses coded into classifiers. Serenata de Amor Operation ended up as the most popular crowdfunded technology project on Brazil and has already reported 219 representatives for unlawful expenses, questioned 378,000 BRL worth of reimbursements, and seen financial resources returned to the public purse. \n\nAna and Jessica share how they were able to collect, wrangle and analyze this Open Data in a country that is conversely highly corrupt and highly transparent.

The digital city model, once a tool for administrative planners, architects and other experts, was now available to everybody — at least in theory. But what are common citizens supposed to do with gigabytes of complex geometries? \n\nIn an effort to get more people involved, the Ideation Lab at Technologiestiftung Berlin converted the model to work within Minecraft, a computer game especially popular with children and young adults. The Berlin map, available as a free download, enables young citizens to engage with their city and to redesign every building block by block. \n\nIn partnership with Joblinge, a local non-profit supporting school drop-outs and other disadvantaged teenagers, the Ideation Lab worked with a group of 12 teenagers on the ambitious project of redesigning Alexanderplatz, one of Berlin’s most prominent (and, arguably, ugly) public squares. \n\nThe group spoke with architects and city planners, conducted a series of on-site interviews and finally build their own version of Alexanderplatz in Minecraft. Learn how more citizens can be motivated to participate in urban planning by adding gamification to public datasets — and especially children and teenagers, who are often underrepresented in traditional public discourse."

Through this technique, the close relationship between housing price and school resources can somewhat loosen, the resources of wealthier families can flow to a wider array of schools, and children from less-wealthy households can gain the advantages of a more economically diverse school environment and increased choice for where their children attend school. \n\nCivic Technology tools are playing a key role in improving the availability of information about schooling options to parents and increasing their interest in schools beyond their closest option. Eric examines the development process and effects of several “school chooser” tools currently implemented in the US and European cities of Vilnius, Boston, and Oakland.\n"

However, Open Culture Foundation finds that there are significant structural issues at stake which, if left unfixed, will leave the concept of Open Government as little more than a beautiful slogan for Taiwan. \n\nA recent report found many issues requiring attention: its concerns include the finding that opinions gathered via civic participation are having little effect on policy decisions; and an inflexible and corrupt procurement process impedes innovative collaboration between the government and tech communities. \n\nPo Yun and Mg share key points from this research, and invite experts from both fields to join the debate.

          "abstract": "The Digital Society mission is part of the French Digital Agency, a governmental agency overseen by the Ministry for the Economy. It aims to provide citizens with the ability to seize the numerous opportunities brought forth by the digital revolution. \n\nIn France, Civic Technologies are becoming more and more widespread, with a thriving Open Source community supporting the efforts. But it is important that they reach people who have previously been excluded from the democratic process  — and often, the same people are struggling economically as are lacking digital skills. \n\nTaking stock of the many diverse types of training centre across France, the Digital Society created a voucher that local and national authorities could provide to citizens needing help woth digital democracy or the digitalization of administrative procedures. \n\nOriane presents the results of a five-month experiment, conducted in three French local districts: local tax departments issued vouchers to citizens who did not know how to file their tax returns online. These could be exchanged for basic digital skills training at public internet points. Discover the key findings and learn which parts of the initiative could be implemented in other regions looking to boost digital engagement."

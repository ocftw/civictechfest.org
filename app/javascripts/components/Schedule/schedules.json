These initiatives are aimed at complementing weak or deeply flawed whistleblower protection systems in many countries, and now form a part of the real-world global journalism ecosystem. Despite their prevalence, until now research into the realities of running such sites has been lacking.\nMasayuki scrutinizes the history of leaksites and gives a brief overview of background technologies (including SecureDrop, GlobaLeaks and several obscure, now-defunct ones). Drawing on his original research of existing leaksites, based on a taxonomy and the several demographics available, Masayuki presents several case studies of notable examples and discusses their social impacts as well as the legal, cultural and political issues they provoke.\nFinally, he chronicles the genesis of his own leaksite for Japan, Whistleblowing.jp, and explains how it operates within the existing Japanese whistleblower protection system and newly enacted Special Secrecy Law.",

Using a dedicated platform known as Budeshi it was possible to demonstrate to public institutions the benefits of using unique identifiers to link budget and procurement data to public services. \nThe adoption resulted in an influx of requests and commitment from public institutions. One immediate result may be a reduction in the administrative burden of responding to Freedom of Information requests, as procurement information would be proactively published in a coherent way. \nThe process of piloting these standards holds several lessons, challenges and opportunities that showcase how Civic Technology can transform interactions between government and citizens; and how that can impact public service delivery.",

The digital city model, once a tool for administrative planners, architects and other experts, was now available to everybody \u2014 at least in theory. But what are common citizens supposed to do with gigabytes of complex geometries? \nIn an effort to get more people involved, the Ideation Lab at Technologiestiftung Berlin converted the model to work within Minecraft, a computer game especially popular with children and young adults. The Berlin map, available as a free download, enables young citizens to engage with their city and to redesign every building block by block. \nIn partnership with Joblinge, a local non-profit supporting school drop-outs and other disadvantaged teenagers, the Ideation Lab worked with a group of 12 teenagers on the ambitious project of redesigning Alexanderplatz, one of Berlin\u2019s most prominent (and, arguably, ugly) public squares. \nThe group spoke with architects and city planners, conducted a series of on-site interviews and finally build their own version of Alexanderplatz in Minecraft. Learn how more citizens can be motivated to participate in urban planning by adding gamification to public datasets \u2014 and especially children and teenagers, who are often underrepresented in traditional public discourse.",

Through this technique, the close relationship between housing price and school resources can somewhat loosen, the resources of wealthier families can flow to a wider array of schools, and children from less-wealthy households can gain the advantages of a more economically diverse school environment and increased choice for where their children attend school. \nCivic Technology tools are playing a key role in improving the availability of information about schooling options to parents and increasing their interest in schools beyond their closest option.

              "abstract": "This session will discuss how open data is catalyzed to inform much needed reforms in the oil, gas and mining sectors. The Natural Resource Governance Institute will address this question by drawing from its work and partners in Asia. In Myanmar, we will explore how open data and published reports on \u2018conflict minerals\u2019, especially jade and gemstones, are being transformed into interactive portal and visuals, leveraged for policy dialogue with the decision-makers, and used to mobilize the media and civil society as they engage in the development of a new mineral law and the institutional overhaul of Myanmar Gemstone Enterprise (MGE), a state-owned company. In the Philippines, an NRGI partner will describe how the disclosure of mining contracts and payments to sub-national governments is catalyzing community participation in the management of local share in mining revenues while being used in doing fiscal modeling on large mining projects with huge environmental and social costs. The discussion will also address questions on approaches and scaling up multi-stakeholder use of open data to sustain the impacts to extractive policy making and implementation. \nOrganizer: Natural Resource Governance Institute",
